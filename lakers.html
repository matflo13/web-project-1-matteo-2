          The 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers are widely regarded as one of the
          greatest basketball teams of all time. Led by Hall of Famers Jerry
          West and Wilt Chamberlain, the Lakers finished the regular season with
          a record of 69-13, the best in NBA history at the time. This season
          stood alone as the best regular season record for the next 24 years,
          when the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls went 72-10. They went on to win the NBA
          Championship, defeating the New York Knicks in the Finals 4-1.

        <h3>The Lakers Star Trio</h3>
        <p>
          The 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers were led by a trio of superstars: Jerry
          West, Wilt Chamberlain, and Gail Goodrich. At the beginning of the
          season, they also had all-time great Elgin Baylor, but he retired 9
          games into the season after realizing his body could not take another
          season. Still, this group of stars thrived in the league, recording a
          33-game win streak, and leading the Lakers to a 69-13 record and an
          NBA championship.
        </p>
        <h4>Jerry West</h4>

          <figcaption>Jerry West</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Jerry West, also known as "Mr. Clutch," was the Lakers' leader and
          primary scorer. West was known for his insanely accurate shooting and
          his ability to perform in clutch moments. He was a 14-time NBA
          All-Star and was named to the All-NBA First Team 12 times during his
          career. West was also a great defender, earning 5 All-Defensive Team
          selections over his career. After his retirement, West was made the
          logo of the NBA and became a successful executive who was a key factor
          in building the Lakers' championship teams in the 1980s.
        </p>
        <h4>Wilt Chamberlain</h4>

          <figcaption>Wilt Chamberlain</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Wilt Chamberlain was one of the most dominant players in NBA history.
          Standing at 7'1", he was a physical force on the court, known for his
          unstoppable scoring ability and rebounding skill. Wilt averaged 50.4
          points per game during the 1961-62 season, a record that still stands
          today. He also averaged an incredible 30.1 points and 22.9 rebounds
          per game over his career, and he holds many NBA records, including
          scoring 100 points in a single game. However, in the later years of
          his career when his athleticism declined, Wilt focused more on
          defense, rebounding and team-oriented basketball. In the 1971-72
          season, he averaged a career-low 14.8 points per game, but he was a
          key rebounder for the Lakers, leading the league in boards. He was a
          13-time All-Star and won 4 MVP awards during his career, including one
          MVP award in his rookie year. Wilt won his second NBA championship
          with the Lakers in 1972.

        <h4>Gail Goodrich</h4>

          <figcaption>Gail Goodrich</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Gail Goodrich was a key player for the Lakers during their
          championship run in the early 1970s. Known for his smooth scoring
          ability, Goodrich was a 5-time All-Star and was named to the All-NBA
          First Team in 1974. He played a crucial role in the Lakers' success,
          providing reliable scoring alongside Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain.
