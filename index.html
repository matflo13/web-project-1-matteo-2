          stand out as the best of all time. Here are some of the most notable
          ones:
          <!--
            I used text decorations to bold the team names.
          -->
          <b> 1995-96 Chicago Bulls, </b>
          <b> 2016-17 Golden State Warriors, </b>
          and
          <b> 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers. </b>
          Each of these teams had a unique combination of talent, coaching, and
          chemistry that allowed them to dominate their opponents and leave a
          lasting legacy in NBA history.

        This section adds a table to help compare the teams, with their records and season outcomes included.
        I added the <thead> and <tbody> tags since I saw them on w3schools and they help with 
        organization, and maybe CSS if I end up adding it.
