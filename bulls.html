          You're probably familiar with Michael Jordan. Whether you're a
          basketball superfan or a casual viewer, his impact on the game is
          undeniable. Jordan was known for his incredible scoring, unbelievable
          athleticism, lockdown defense, and competitive spirit. He won five
          regular-season MVP awards and six NBA championships with the Bulls,
          earning Finals MVP honors each time. He is widely regarded as the
          greatest basketball player of all time.

        <h4>Scottie Pippen</h4>

        <p>
          Scottie Pippen was the perfect Robin to Jordan's Batman. He was a
          versatile forward who could score, pass, and defend at an elite level.
          Pippen often flew under the radar due to Jordan's dominance, but
          still, he was a crucial part of the Bulls' success, and is still
          considered to be one of the best small forwards in NBA history. Pippen
          was known for his defensive prowess, earning eight All-Defensive First
          Team selections during his career, and was also a skilled playmaker
          and a reliable scorer.
        </p>
        <h4>Dennis Rodman</h4>

          <figcaption>Dennis Rodman</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Dennis Rodman was the Bulls' enforcer and best rebounder. Known for
          his wild personality and colorful hair, Rodman was one of the best
          rebounders in NBA history, leading the league in rebounds per game for
          seven consecutive seasons. He was also a great defender, earning two
          NBA Defensive Player of the Year awards. Rodman's ability to grab
          insane amounts of rebounds and defend multiple positions made him a
          key part of the Bulls roster.
