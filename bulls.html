        <h3>The Bulls "Big 3"</h3>
        <p>
          The 1995-96 Chicago Bulls were led by a trio of superstars: Michael
          Jordan, Scottie Pippen, and Dennis Rodman. This "Big 3" was a big part
          of the team's success, with each of them bringing their unique skills
          and talents to the court.
        </p>
        <h4>Michael Jordan</h4>
        <p>
          You're probably familiar with Michael Jordan. Whether you're a
          basketball superfan or a casual viewer, his impact on the game is
          undeniable. Jordan was known for his incredible scoring, unbelievable
          athleticism, lockdown defense, and competitive spirit. He won five
          regular-season MVP awards and six NBA championships with the Bulls,
          earning Finals MVP honors each time. He is widely regarded as the
          greatest basketball player of all time.
        </p>
        <h4>Scottie Pippen</h4>
        <p>
          Scottie Pippen was the perfect Robin to Jordan's Batman. He was a
          versatile forward who could score, pass, and defend at an elite level.
          Pippen often flew under the radar due to Jordan's dominance, but
          still, he was a crucial part of the Bulls' success, and is still
          considered to be one of the best small forwards in NBA history. Pippen
          was known for his defensive prowess, earning eight All-Defensive First
          Team selections during his career, and was also a skilled playmaker
          and a reliable scorer.
